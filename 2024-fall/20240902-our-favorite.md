### Title:
Our favorite theorem

### Abstract:
This is the first meeting---let's get to know each other by presenting our own favorites!
The scheduled slot is 1.5 hour, let's try to conclude on time.
That is, depending on the number of speakers, everyone may use 10-20 minutes.
Please **let me know if you want to speak by Friday** so I can count and let everyone know the number and length of time slots.

I will also briefly chat about the format of meetings:
- The purpose of this seminar is mainly to get theory-minded people together and participate
- Often presenting other people's results is more interesting (than presenting ours)
- In-person and board talks are easier to keep people interested in
- We need speakers, anyone is welcome!

### Notes:

It turns out that we touched a wide range of areas!
- 6-coloring theorem
- threshold graphs
- one-way functions
- convexity of ML
- error-correcting codes
- Myerson theorem
- AKS sorting network
