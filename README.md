We are a group of researchers interested in theoretical computer science (TCS) at UVA.
The goal of this seminar is to share both novel and classic ingenious ideas 
in TCS, broadly speaking.
Potential topics include (but not limited to) algorithms, complexity,
learning theory, coding theory, game theory, and cryptography.
Subscribe to our [mailing list](https://lists.virginia.edu/sympa/info/cs-theory-seminar) if you want to receive updates.

Everyone is welcome to join.
Of course, *you* are more than welcome to give a theory talk!
