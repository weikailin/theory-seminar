Policy on use of AI
--------------------------------------------

The ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is strictly at the discretion of the course's professor and is otherwise prohibited without the professor's explicit written or verbal permission. AI tools may not be cited as authors, though the tools used must be fully disclosed as a source along with the capacity in which they were used. All outputs of artificial intelligence, both explicitly used and as inspiration in one's submission, must be properly cited to its appropriate source.

Students with disabilities or learning needs
--------------------------------------------

It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. For general questions please visit the [SDAC website](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/SDAC). If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

Religious accommodations
------------------------

It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200.

Harassment, Discrimination, and Interpersonal Violence
------------------------

The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the [UVACARE website](https://cavcare.virginia.edu/) that describes reporting options and resources available.

The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status. [UVA policy](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-010) also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior.

If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to [Just Report It](justreportit.virginia.edu) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to [Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”)](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/CAPS) and [Women’s Center (for students of all genders)](https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/counseling/our-counseling-services).

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. 

Support for your career development
------------------------

Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.

Illness and other absences
------------------------

If you are ill, you are encouraged to stay away from classes even on days when quizzes or exams are given. In this case, please email me for corresponding supports and accommondations.

Student support team
------------------------

You have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stresses. In addition to your professor, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has staff members located in Thornton Hall who you can [contact to help manage academic or personal challenges](https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/offices/office-graduate-programs/student-support-services). Please do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help!
