One-Way Functions
=================

Motivation:
Given the impossibility of efficient but perfectly secure encryption, we want to relax our security definition.
Intuitively, we want to

1. encrypt long plaintext many times using a single short key, and
2. perform "fast" encryption and decryption given the legitimate key, and
3. ensure that the recovering of plaintext is "hard" without the key.

One-time pads achieves 2 and 3 but not 1. However, OTP achieves 3 only bcs the key space is as large as message.
Since we want 1, the key space is relatively small.
Very vague, we want a encryption that is easy to compute (to achieve 1) but hard to find any $k,m$ that $\Enc_k(m) = c$.
(This is vague bcs we can still try any $k'$ to decrypt $c$.)

This suggests that we require functions that are 

> "easy" to compute but "hard" to invert.

That is called "one-wayness" in this lecture.
We next define easy and hard computation in terms of efficiency and probability.

Efficient Computation and Efficient Adversaries
------------------

We want to provide "efficient computation" to the honest users.

#### **Definition:** Deterministic Algorithm

{: .defn}
> An algo $\cA$ is a deterministic Turing Machine with input and output as bit strings, $\bit^*$.

Note: TM is by definition *uniform*, that is, its description size is constant for all unbounded long inputs.

#### **Definition:** Polynomial Running-Time

{: .defn}
> $\cA$ runs in time $T(n)$ if $\forall x \in \bits$, 
> $\cA(x)$ halts within $T(|x|)$ steps. 
> $\cA$ runs in *polynomial time* if there exists a constant $c$ such that $\cA$ runs
> in time $T(n) = n^c$.

#### **Definition:** Efficient Computation

{: .defn}
> We say an algo is *efficient* if it runs in polynomial time.

Justification of poly time:

- Indep of computation models (TM, circuit, ...)
- Closed under compositions of algos
- From human experience: poly-time become cubic, but super-poly remain hard

As discussed in perfect secrecy, we need randomized algo to construct encryption (and more generally crypto).

#### **Definition:** Randomized (or Probabilistic) Algorithm

{: .defn}
> A *randomized* algorithm $\cA$, also called a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing Machine
> and abbreviated as PPT, is a deterministic algorithm equipped with an extra random tape. 
> Each bit of the random tape is uniformly and independently chosen.
> 
> We denote the computation by $y \gets \cA(x ; r)$ but sometimes omit $r$.
> Note that the running-time is bounded by a poly for all $(x,r)$.

As an example, we define efficient and correct encryption.

#### **Definition:** Efficient Private-key Encryption.

{: .defn}
> $(\Gen, \Enc, \Dec)$ is called an *efficient private-key encryption scheme* if:
> 1. $k \gets \Gen(1^n)$ is PPT s.t. for every $n \in \N$, it samples $k$.
> 2. $c \gets \Enc_k(m)$ is PPT s.t. $k, m \in \bit^n$, outputs $c$.
> 3. $m \gets \Dec_k(c)$ is PPT s.t. $c, k$, outputs $m \in \bit^n \cup\bot$.
> 4. Correctness: $\forall n \in \N$, $m \in \bit^n$,
> 
> $$
> \Pr [k \gets \Gen(1^n) : \Dec_k(\Enc_k(m)) = m]] = 1.
> $$

Note: the notation $1^n$ means the string of $n$ copies 1's, it is called the *security parameter*.
The purpose is to instantiate the "security" of the scheme, e.g., $n$-bit key.
We write unary $1^n$ (but not $n$ as binary) because "poly-time" is defined by the input length.

### Adversaries: Non-Uniform

Next we want to model adversaries with a stronger capability than honest.

#### **Definition:** Non-Uniform PPT

{: .defn}
> A *non-uniform* PPT machine (abbreviated nuPPT) $\cA$ is a sequence
> of algos $\cA = \set{\cA_1, \cA_2, \dots}$ s.t.:
> - $\cA_i$ computes on inputs of length $i$, and
> - exists a polynomial $d$ s.t. the description size $|A_i| \lt d(i)$ 
>   and the time $\cA_i$ is also less than $d(i)$. 
> We write $\cA(x)$ to denote the computation $\cA_{|x|}(x)$.
> 
> Alternatively, an nuPPT algo can be defined as a *uniform* PPT $\cA$ that
> takes an additional *advice* string of poly length $d(i)$ for each input length $i$.

Purpose: 
non-uniform gives adv extra power and models many real scenario, 
e.g., Eve may have a list of known (plain, cipher) pairs.

Discuss: the advice may not be computable in poly time 
(if poly-time, then no need to take advice as input). NU is closed under reduction.

Definition of One-Way Functions
------------------

We try to define OWF using efficient computation and efficient adversary.

The first may come from NP-hardness.

#### **Attempt:** (Worst-Case)
> A function $f : \bits \to \bits$ is one-way if both of the following hold:
> 1. Easy to compute. There is a PPT $C$ that computes $f (x)$ on all inputs $x \in \bits$.
> 2. Hard to Invert. No nuPPT adversary $\cA$, for all $n\in\N$ and $x \in \bit^n$, 
> 
>    $$
>    \Pr[\cA(1^n, f (x)) \in f^{-1}( f (x))] = 1.
>    $$

This is implied by $NP \not\subseteq BPP$, which is
a long-open complexity problem.
Majority of $x$ are easy (even we set prob $\ge 1 - 1/poly$), open if it is useful for encryption.

Note: nuPPT can store any poly, so there may be more than poly are hard.

#### **Attempt:**
> A function $f : \bits \to \bits$ is one-way if both of the following hold:
> 1. Easy to compute. There is a PPT $C$ that computes $f (x)$ on all inputs $x \in \bits$.
> 2. Hard to Invert. For all nuPPT adversary $\cA$, for all $n\in\N$ and $x \in \bit^n$, 
> 
>    $$
>    \Pr[\cA(1^n, f (x)) \in f^{-1}( f (x))] \leq 2^{-n}.
>    $$

Impossible: too strong, $\cA$ is NU and could have many $(x, f(x))$ pairs. 
Note: $\cA$ takes $1^n$ as the security parameter in case $|f(x)| \ll n$.

Randomize $x$:

#### **Attempt:**

> 2\. Hard to Invert. For any nuPPT adversary $\cA$, for all $n\in\N$, 
> 
>    $$
>    \Pr[x \gets \bit^n; y \gets f(x) : f(\cA(1^n, y)) = y] \leq 2^{-n}.
>    $$

Still too strong: $\cA$ can take poly time to slash some of the possible $x$.

We may relax by $poly(n) / 2^n$ or $2^{-0.1 n}$ on the RHS, but they still too strong to find a candidate.
We formalize "very small" as follows.

#### **Definition:** Negligible Function

{: .defn}
> Func $\eps(n)$ is *negligible* if for every $c$, there exists some $n_0$ s.t.
> $\forall n > n_0, \eps(n) \le 1/n^c$.

Note: $\eps$ is smaller than any inverse poly for sufficiently large $n$.

Note: when the probability is $\ge 1-\eps(n)$, we often call it "overwhelming".

#### **Definition:** (Strong) One-Way Function

{: .defn}
> A function $f : \bits \to \bits$ is *one-way* if both of the following hold:
> 1. Easy to compute. There is a PPT $C$ that computes $f (x)$ on all inputs $x \in \bits$.
> 2. Hard to Invert. For any nuPPT adversary $\cA$, there exists a negligible function $\eps$ 
>    that for any $n\in\N$,
> 
>    $$
>    \Pr[x \gets \bit^n; y \gets f(x) : f(\cA(1^n, y)) = y] \leq \eps(n).
>    $$

Note: each $\cA$ has a different $\eps$. The definition is asymptotic.

The above definition is standard in literature, but it is still hard to construct:
any adversary can only invert a tiny fraction.
Many natural candidates, such as factoring, does not meet this.
We relax it:

#### **Definition:** Weak One-Way Function

{: .defn}
> A function $f : \bits \to \bits$ is *weak one-way* if (... same as strong OWF.)
> 
> 2\. Hard to Invert. There exists a polynomial $q: \N \to \N$ such that for any nuPPT adversary $\cA$, 
>    for sufficiently large $n\in \N$,
> 
>    $$
>    \Pr[x \gets \bit^n; y \gets f(x) : f(\cA(1^n, y)) = y] \leq 1 - 1/q(n).
>    $$

Note: here the prob. $1-1/q$ is *the same* for all adv $\cA$, 
but in the strong OWF, the prob. $\eps$ is different and *depends* on $\cA$.

Primes and Factoring
--------------------

Define $f_\mul: \N^2 \to \N$ by

$$
f_\mul(x,y) = \begin{cases}
1  & \text{if } x = 1 \text{ or } y = 1 \text{(eliminating trivial invert)}\\
x \cdot y & \text{o.w.}
\end{cases}
$$

Easy to compute. For many $(x,y)$ are "easy" to invert: w.p. at least 3/4 when $xy$ even.
It is not strong OWF.

#### **Assumption:** Factoring

{: .defn}
> For any adv $\cA$, there exists a negligible function $\eps$ s.t.
> 
> $$
> \Pr[(p,q) \gets \Pi_n^2; N \gets pq : \cA(N) \in \set{p,q}] \lt \eps(n),
> $$
> 
> where $\Pi_n := \set{p \lt 2^n : p \text{ prime}}$ is the set of primes less than $2^n$.

### The Prime Number Theorem

Define $\pi(x)$ as the number of primes $\le x$.
PNT states that primes are dense.

#### **Theorem:** (Chebychev, 1848)

{: .theorem}
> For all $x>1$, $\pi(x) \gt \frac{x}{2 \log x}$.

Note: the above is easier to prove, but the famous *Prime Number Theorem* is $\pi(x) \sim x / \ln x$ when $x \to \infty$.
The above $\log$ is base 2.

#### **Theorem:**

{: .theorem}
> If the factoring assumption is true, then $f_\mul$ is a weak OWF.

{: .proof} 
> $f_\mul$ is easy to compute. Hard to invert?

Note: the above reduction assumes efficient primality testing. That is not necessary, left as exercise.

Note: the pattern is common in crypto.
Reduction *from* Assumption (factoring) *to* Construction (OWF) is bread and butter in this course.

## From Weak OWF to Strong OWF

The existence of OWF is long-open.
We will show that strong and weak OWFs are existentially equivalent.
Clearly, any strong OWF satisfies weak. The challenge is from weak to strong.

We begin with a warmup.

#### **Claim:**

{: .theorem}
> If $\set{f_n: \bit^n \to \bit^l}_{n\in\N}$ is a strong OWF, 
> then $g(x_1,x_2) := (f(x_1), f(x_2))$ is also a strong OWF.

{: .proof}
> Assume for contradiction (AC), there exist poly $p(n)$ and a nuPPT adv $A$ such that 
> for infinitely many $n\in\N$, 
> 
> $$
> \Pr[x_1,x_2 \gets \bit^n; y = g(x_1,x_2) : g(A(1^{2n}, y)) = y] \gt 1/p(n).
> $$
> 
> We construct nuPPT $B$ that inverts $f$.
> 
>> Algorithm $B(1^n, y)$:
>> 1. $x_2 \gets \bit^n$ and $y_2 = f(x_2)$.
>> 2. Run $x'_1, x'_2 \gets A(1^{2n}, (y,y_2))$.
>> 3. Output $x'_1$ if $f(x'_1) = y$.
> 
> For uniform $z\gets \bit^n$, the above $(y,y_2)$ is the same distribution

> 
> Also, when $A$ inverts $(y,y_2)$, we have that $B$ inverts $z$ successfully.
> By (AC), $A$ inverts w.p. $\gt 1/p$, greater than any negligible function, 
> and it contradicts that $f$ is a strong OWF.

Note: this is a typical template to prove security by reduction. 
The quantifiers of (AC) is often the same (to negate negligible).

Observation: the definition of weak states that *exist* poly $q(n)$ *for all* nuPPT;
that is, even weak, there is a good fraction, $1/q$, of instances that are hard for all.

Idea: we repeat the weak $f$ for poly many instances and ask the Adv to invert all,
so that Adv fails with high prob.

#### **Theorem:**

{: .theorem}
> For any weak OWF $f_n: \bit^n \to \bit^l$, there exists a poly $m(n)$ such that 
> 
> $$
> g(x_1, ..., x_m) := (f(x_1), ..., f(x_m))
> $$
> 
> from $g: \bit^{mn} \to \bit^{ml}$ is a strong OWF.

Note: by def, there exists a poly $q(n)$ s.t. no adv can invert $f$ w.p. $1-1/q(n)$.

#### **Proof:**

Assume for contradiction (AC), there exists a nuPPT adv $A$ and poly $p(n)$ 
s.t. for inf many $n\in\N$, $A$ inverts $g$ w.p. $\ge 1/p$, i.e.,

$$
\Pr[\set{x_i\gets\bit^n, y_i \gets f(x_i)}_{i\in[m]}, y \gets (y_1...y_m) : g(A(1^n, y)) = y] \ge 1/p(n).
$$

We want to construct a nuPPT $B$ to invert $y=f(x)$ for uniform $x \gets \bit^n$ by running $A$.
So, the idea is to transform $y$ into an output of $g$, that is $(y_1,..., y_m)$.
How? $(y,y, ..., y)$? $(y,y_2, ..., y_m)$? 

We construct $B_0$ as below to run $A$.

{: .defn}
> Algorithm $B_0(1^n, y)$:
> 
> 1. $j \gets [m]$
> 2. $x_1, ..., x_m \gets \bit^{n}$
> 3. let $y_i \gets f(x_i)$ for all $i$
> 4. let $y_j \gets y$
> 5. run $x'_1, .., x'_m \gets A(1^{mn}, (y_1,..., y_m))$
> 6. if $f(x'_j) = y$, output $x_j$, otherwise output $\bot$.

Note: $B_0$ inverts $y$ w.p. roughly $1/p$ by (AC), but our goal is to invert w.p. $1-1/q \gg 1/p$.
Hence, repeating $B_0(y)$ is necessary.

{: .defn}
> Algorithm $B(1^n, y)$:
> 
> 1. repeatedly run $B_0(y)$ poly $r_1(n)$ many times using fresh randomness
> 2. output the first non $\bot$ output of $B_0$.

Note: we use the same $y$ as input, and that makes the probability analysis involved 
since the repetition is *dependent*.

By (AC), inverting $g$ is easy, intuitively there are many $(x,y=f(x))$ that can be inverted by $B_0(y)$.
Clearly that holds for $A$, but as mentioned, we need to prove it for $B_0$.

The following claim is the key.

#### **Claim:** (many easy instances)

{: .theorem}
> Suppose that (AC) holds.
> There exists a "large" set $G_n$ of "easy" instances, 
> 
> $$
> G_n := \set{x \in \bit^n : \Pr_{x, y=f(x)}[f(B_0(y)) = y] \geq 1/r_2(n)}
> $$
> 
> for some poly $r_2(n)$, 
> and $|G| \geq (1 - 1/2q)\cdot 2^n$.

If the claim holds, then $B$ can invert by repeating $B_0$:

$$
\newcommand{\tinv}{\text{ inv}}
\newcommand{\tnotinv}{\text{ not}\tinv}
\newcommand{\tall}{\text{all }}
\newcommand{\tsome}{\text{some }}
\begin{align*}
\Pr_{x,y}[B \tnotinv] 
 & = \Pr[B \tnotinv \cap x \in G] + \Pr[B \tnotinv \cap x \notin G] \\
 & \le \Pr[B \tnotinv | x \in G] + \Pr[x \notin G] \\
 & \le (1-1/r_2)^{r_1} + 1/2q \\
 & \le e^{-n} + 1/2q \le 1/q
\end{align*}
$$

We will choose $r_1(n) := n \cdot r_2(n)$ to get $(1-1/r_2)^{r_1} \le e^{-n}$.

Then, $B$ inverts w.p. $\gt 1-1/q$, and it is contradicting that $f$ is weak OWF.
It remains to prove the claim.

It remains to show that every composite has many strong witnesses.
The first step is to exclude perfect powers.
The second step is to show that other composites have many strong witnesses.

A Universal OWF
--------------------

The idea is to construct a function that computes all easy-to-compute functions.

#### **Function:** $f_\univ$

{: .defn}
> Input: $y$, 
> let $n := |y|$.
> 
> 1. Interpret $y$ as a pair $(M,x)$ of Turing machine and bitstring,
>    where $|M| = \log n$
> 2. Run $M$ on $x$ for $T=n^2$ steps
> 3. If $M$ halts in $T$ steps, output $(M,M(x))$; otherwise, output $\bot$.

#### **Theorem:** A Universal Weak OWF

{: .theorem}
> If there exists a OWF, then the above function $f_\univ$ is a weak OWF.

To prove it, we will use the following lemma.

#### **Lemma:** Strong OWF in time $O(n^2)$

{: .theorem}
> If there exists a strongly one-way function $g$ , then there exists 
> a strongly one-way function $g'$ that is computable in time $O(n^2)$.

Intuition: 
If there exists a strong OWF $g$ in time $O(n^2)$, then there exists (at least) a TM $M_g$ that computes $g$ in $O(n^2)$ steps
such that the description length $|M_g| = d$ is a constant.
WLOG, assume the description of any TM can be padded with a special $\bot$ symbol to arbitrary long.
For any $s \ge |M_g|$, let $M_{g,s}$ be the description of $M_g$ padded to $s$ bits.
Then, for all sufficiently large $n$, 
the $\log n$-bit random prefix of $y$ is exactly $M_{g,\log n}$ w.p. $1/n$.
Hence, $f_\univ(y)$ is hard to invert.

Formally, assume for contra (AC),
for all poly $q(n)$, there exists NUPPT $A$ s.t. for infinitely many $n\in\N$,

$$
\Pr[y\gets \bit^n, z \gets f_\univ(y) : f_\univ(A(1^n, z)) = z] \gt 1 - 1/q.
$$

We construct NUPPT $B$ that inverts $z' \gets g(x)$ for $x\gets \bit^{n-\log n}$ by

1. Run $y \gets A(1^n, (M_g,z'))$.
2. Interpret $y$ as $(M, x)$.
3. If $M = M_g$ and $z' = g(x)$, output $x$; otherwise, output $\bot$.


**Notice**{: .label}
We uses $M_g$ in $B$ because $B$ is asked to invert $g$, 
which means that we know $g$ in this proof.
Alternatively, we prove it *without* AC in lecture, 
and there is only probability analysis which does not depend on $g$. 

By (AC), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
1/q
& \ge \Pr[A \tnotinv] \\
& \ge \Pr[A \tnotinv | y = (M_g, \star)] \Pr[y = (M_g, \star)] \\
= \Pr[A \tnotinv | y = (M_g, \star)] \cdot (1/n).
\end{align*}
$$

Notice that 

$$
\Pr[A \tnotinv | y = (M_g, \star)] = \Pr[x\gets\bit^{n-\log n}, z' \gets g(x) : B \tnotinv].
$$

Hence, we have 

$$
\Pr[B \tnotinv] \le n / q(n).
$$

Choosing $q(n) = n^2$ and $A$ correspondingly, we have $B$ inverts w.p. at least $1-1/n$,
that is greater than $1/p(m)$ for some polynomial $p$ and the input size $m:= n - \log n$ of $g$,
contradicts $g$ is a strong OWF.

Note:
The above construction is impractical due to inefficiency. 
Suppose there exists a OWF that is easy to compute by a TM of 1000 bits.
The above needs a "sufficiently long" input so that $\log n \ge 1000$ to be a weak OWF, which means $|x| \ge 2^{1000}$.


Collection of OWFs
--------------------

To construct OWFs efficiently, many mathematical / computational assumptions are considered.
The intuition is to consider *efficiently sampleable* distributions instead of uniformly random strings.
The typical syntax is PPT algos $(\Gen, \Samp)$:

- $\pp \gets \Gen(1^n)$
- $x \gets \Samp(1^n, \pp)$
- $f_\pp : \bit^n \to \bit^\ast$

And then, for all NUPPT adversary $A$, there exists a negligible function $\eps$ such that

$$
\Pr[\pp\gets\Gen(1^n), x \gets \Samp(1^n, \pp), y \gets f_\pp(x) : f_\pp(A(1^n, \pp, y)) = 1] \le \eps(n).
$$

For example, given the factoring assumption, we can construct a collection of OWF by 

- let $\Gen$ output $n$ directly,
- let $\Samp$ output two $n$-bit primes uniformly at random (using primality testing), and 
- let $f_\pp$ be the $n$-bit multiplication.

Other collections (such as RSA, discrete logarithm, or Rabin) are more involved in their constructions,
and they provide additional "properties" on top of OWF.

<!-- 
Other stuff, wanted to say discrete logarithm.
Z*_p can be proved to be a cyclic group, and it is a permutation such that the range is exactly the domain,
but its generator can be hard to find, and it can even be easy to solve DL due to the even order.
Choosing p = 2q + 1 for both p, q prime and then choosing the subgroup G_q of Z*_p is good DL,
every element is generator, but the domain is Z_q while the range g^x in G_q is represented in Z*_p,
and we may not have good way to map it back to Z_q.

Maybe leave it to PKE, or just use LWE then.

#### **Theorem:** generators are dense

> see exercise 3.2.1.2–16. In fact, primitive roots are rather numerous.
