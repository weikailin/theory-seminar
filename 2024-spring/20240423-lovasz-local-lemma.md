### Title:
Lovász Local Lemma and its Applications in Randomized Algorithms

### Abstract:
Lovasz's Local Lemma is a celebrated tool of the probabilistic method, often used in proving the existence of certain math objects without explicit constructions. In this seminar, we will discuss Lovasz's Local Lemma and its applications in randomized algorithms and analysis.

### Speaker bio:
Zirou is a 4th year Ph.D. student in CS working on optimization and foundation of social systems.
