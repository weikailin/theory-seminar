### Title:
The probabilistic method and its applications

### Abstract:
The probabilistic method is a powerful technique to prove the existence of math objects that satisfy certain desirable properties (e.g., a proper coloring of a graph, a dominating set with bounded size). In this seminar, we give a tour of its usage in subjects such as combinatorics and number theory.

Here are some applications that will be covered:

1. Bounding the Ramsey number
2. (Hyper)graph colorings
3. Weierstrass Approximation

### Bio:
Zirou Qiu is a 4th year Ph.D. student working with Prof. Madhav Marathe. He is interested in graph problems from domains such as dynamical systems and game theory.
