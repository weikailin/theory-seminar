### Title:
The probabilistic method and its applications (continued)

### Abstract:
In this seminar, we will extend our discussion of the probabilistic method. In particular, we will look at more applications on random graphs. If time permits, we will also visit the Lovasz local lemma.

### Bio:
Zirou Qiu is a 4th year Ph.D. student working with Prof. Madhav Marathe. He is interested in graph problems from domains such as dynamical systems and game theory.
