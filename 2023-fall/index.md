We are a group of researchers interested in theoretical computer science (TCS) at UVA.
The goal of this seminar is to share both novel and classic ingenious ideas 
in TCS, broadly speaking.
Potential topics include (but not limited to) algorithms, complexity,
learning theory, coding theory, game theory, and cryptography.

Fall 2023: we are planning to meeting biweekly, see the schedule below.

Everyone is welcome to join.
Of course, *you* are more than welcome to give a theory talk! 
Please send us an email to:
